			<h1>TownSpot Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p class="sub-heading">TownSpot was created with the principal purpose of spotlighting the talents, skills and services of local artists and merchants in an exciting, accessible and secure platform. To accomplish this and provide you with the benefits and opportunities presented through our Service, we collect and use information you provide.</p>
			<p class="sub-heading">We know that you care how your information is used. We will use it carefully and sensibly to bring the very best features and functionalities to the Service, and enhance them in the future. This notice describes our privacy policy regarding your personal information. By using the Service, you knowingly accept these terms as described herein.</p>
			<h2>Personal Information</h2>

For example, membership information such as a user's contact name, address, phone number or related information may be maintained by TownSpot for purposes of providing our website users, Member Account holders and merchants with the best website interphase and functionality. These purposes include, but are not limited to enhancing our features and services, and improving the design and infrastructure of TownSpot's website. This information will be maintained by TownSpot and will not be sold, traded or otherwise provided to other users, Member Account holders, merchants or any other third-party.
					<br><br>We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). TownSpot may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Member Account.
